# Google Cloud Training Demos
This Open Source repository was launched on the 21st of July 2024 by a Google Cloud Authorized trainer. An initial set of demo scripts used during numerious Google Cloud training sessions were released with the launch of the project.

The purpose of this open source project is to share fully automated scripts that reduce the time and effort needed to experience Google Cloud platform features. 

Each script must be self contained, offering a preview, execution and delete mode. The scripts should be implemented following the coding guidelines, and designed to be executed in newly created Google Cloud project. 

To avoid incurring additional charges, we recommend deleting the project at the end of the exploration.
