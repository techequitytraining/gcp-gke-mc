# Multi-Cloud Kubernetes Management with GKE Enterprise

## 🌐 Automate and Manage Kubernetes Across GCP, Azure, and AWS

Welcome to the cutting-edge demo script that showcases the power of Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Enterprise in managing multi-cloud Kubernetes environments. This fully automated script provisions and attaches Kubernetes clusters from Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), demonstrating GKE's ability to centrally manage any Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) compliant cluster.

### 🚀 What This Demo Offers

- **Multi-Cloud Automation**: Automatically provision GKE, AKS, and EKS clusters with a single script.
- **GKE Enterprise Attached Clusters**: Experience seamless attachment and management of non-GKE clusters.
- **Connect Gateway**: Explore unified multi-cluster deployment capabilities.
- **Cross-Cloud Management**: Centralize operations for Kubernetes clusters across major cloud providers.
- **CNCF Compliance**: Demonstrate interoperability with any CNCF-compliant Kubernetes cluster.

### 🔍 Key Features Explored

1. **Automated Cluster Provisioning**: Set up GKE, AKS, and EKS clusters using provider-specific CLI tools.
2. **GKE Attached Clusters**: Attach and manage non-GKE clusters through Google Cloud Console.
3. **Connect Gateway**: Implement automated deployment pipelines across all attached clusters.
4. **Multi-Cluster Operations**: Perform consistent management tasks across diverse Kubernetes environments.
5. **Centralized Monitoring**: Gain unified visibility into all clusters from the Google Cloud Console.
6. **Policy Management**: Apply consistent policies across multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments.
7. **Cross-Cluster Networking**: Explore advanced networking capabilities between attached clusters.

### 💡 Why This Matters
